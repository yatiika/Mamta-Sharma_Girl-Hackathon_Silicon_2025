GH-2025-Silicon-Engineering : DeepLogicAI: AI-Based Combinational Logic Depth Prediction

    Problem Statement: AI algorithm to predict combinational complexity/depth of signals to quickly identify timing violations.

Timing analysis is a crucial step in the design of any complex IP/SoC. However, timing analysis reports are generated after synthesis is complete, which is a very time consuming process. This leads to overall delays in the project execution time as timing violations can require architectural refactoring.

Creating an AI algorithm to predict combinational logic depth of signals in behavioural RTL can greatly speed up this process.

approach used to generate the algorithm

Our approach consists of three main steps: Feature Extraction, Machine Learning Model Training, and Prediction for New RTL Designs. Each step is carefully designed to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
1. Feature Extraction from RTL
Parsing the RTL Code: We use Yosys, an open-source synthesis tool, to convert the Verilog/VHDL RTL code into a gate-level netlist. This provides a structural representation of the circuit.
Building a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): The gate-level netlist is represented as a DAG, where:
Nodes represent logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.).
Edges represent connections between gates.
Extracting Key Features: Using graph traversal techniques, we extract relevant features such as:
Fan-in/Fan-out: Number of input/output connections for each gate.
Gate Count: Total number of logic elements in the design.
Longest Combinational Path: Determined using topological sorting and dynamic programming to compute the longest path in the DAG.
2. Machine Learning Model Training
Dataset Preparation: We use benchmark datasets (e.g., ISCAS, OpenCores, MCNC) consisting of RTL designs with known logic depths from synthesis reports.
Feature Engineering: Normalize extracted features and encode categorical variables where necessary.
Model Selection: We train a Random Forest/XGBoost regression model, which learns the mapping between extracted features and combinational depth.
Training Process:
Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., number of trees, max depth) to optimize accuracy.
Use cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
3. Prediction for New RTL Designs
Given a new RTL module, we repeat Step 1 (Feature Extraction) to obtain its circuit characteristics.
The trained ML model then predicts the combinational logic depth in milliseconds, significantly reducing the time required compared to full synthesis.
The result helps designers quickly assess timing risks and refine RTL architectures before detailed implementation.
This AI-driven approach ensures fast and accurate depth estimation, improving timing closure efficiency in digital design workflows


Proof of Correctness


To verify the correctness of our AI-based approach, we use the following validation methods:
1. Ground Truth Comparison
We run traditional synthesis tools (Yosys, Synopsys Design Compiler, or Cadence Genus) to extract the actual combinational logic depth of signals.
Our predicted depth is compared with the true depth obtained from synthesis reports.
2. Model Evaluation Metrics
We use standard regression metrics to measure the accuracy of our predictions:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average prediction error.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Penalizes larger errors more heavily.
R² Score: Measures how well our model explains variance in logic depth.
3. Cross-Validation
We perform k-fold cross-validation on training data to avoid overfitting and ensure generalizability.
4. Functional Testing on New RTL Modules
The model is tested on unseen RTL designs with varying complexities to check if the predicted depth is consistent and accurate.
5. Sensitivity Analysis
We analyze how changes in fan-in, fan-out, and gate count affect predictions to ensure that the model correctly interprets logic dependencies.
By systematically comparing AI-predicted results with actual synthesis reports and using robust evaluation metrics, we establish the correctness and reliability of our approach.

Complexity Analysis

The overall complexity of our AI-based combinational depth prediction approach can be broken down into three main components
1. Feature Extraction Complexity
Parsing RTL and Generating Netlist:
Using Yosys to extract gate-level netlists takes O(n log n), where n is the number of logic gates.
Building the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):
Representing the netlist as a graph has a complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of logic elements and E is the number of connections.
Finding Longest Path (Combinational Depth):
Using topological sorting and dynamic programming, the longest path can be computed in O(V + E).
Overall Feature Extraction Complexity: O(n log n) + O(V + E)
2. Machine Learning Model Complexity
Training Complexity:
Random Forest: O(d × n log n), where d is the number of trees and n is the training data size.
XGBoost: O(d × n) due to gradient boosting optimizations.
Inference Complexity:
Random Forest/XGBoost: O(1) for small models, O(d log n) for deeper models.
Overall Training Complexity: O(d × n log n)
Overall Inference Complexity: O(1) to O(d log n)
3. Comparison with Traditional Synthesis
Full Synthesis (Baseline Comparison):
Traditional synthesis tools like Synopsys Design Compiler or Cadence Genus take minutes to hours (exponential in worst cases).
AI-Based Prediction:
Our approach reduces this to milliseconds, offering significant speed-up.
Traditional Synthesis Complexity: O(2ⁿ) (Exponential in worst case)
 AI-Based Prediction Complexity: O(n log n) + O(1) (Much faster)
Key Takeaways
 Feature extraction scales efficiently with circuit size (O(n log n)).
Machine learning inference is nearly constant-time (O(1) or O(d log n)).
 Dramatic speed-up over traditional synthesis, making it practical for large-scale SoC/IP designs.
This optimized complexity ensures that our approach is both fast and scalable for modern VLSI design workflows.
